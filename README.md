## Problem Background
`I am a Data Engineer developing a computer vision program powered by an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for a public service organization. The core task of this project is to build a model that can recognize images or objects representing **sign language gestures**, specifically from the **American Sign Language (ASL)** system.`

## Project Output
`The output of my project is model to predict ASL using Computer Vision.`

## Data
`The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle. This dataset consists of images of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures, representing 24 alphabet letters ranging from A to Z, excluding the letters J and Z.`

## Method
This project uses a deep learning approach with CNN-based models. The process includes:
1. Baseline modeling with a simple ANN
2. Transfer learning with an AlexNet-inspired architecture
3. Data preprocessing: image resizing (227Ã—227), normalization, and augmentation
4. Model training with dropout, batch normalization, and adaptive learning rate
5. Evaluation through accuracy/loss plots, classification report, and inference testing.

## Stacks
- Programming: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- Modeling Tools: Keras Sequential API, tf.data pipeline
- Evaluation: Classification report, confusion matrix, accuracy/loss visualization
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
